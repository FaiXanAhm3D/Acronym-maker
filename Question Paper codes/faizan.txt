Everyday, everytime I think about you
When I am doing nothing, I am thinking about you
Never thought that it would end like this with you
Now there is no more conversation between me and you
I have given my best for you
but I guess you never knew
I don’t know how to express my feelings in words
Feels like when we will meet then we would talk
Maybe we can have a walk together
Cuz I want to be with you forever
Do you remember our initial conversations?
When u look back, you get a realization 
How far we have come
how things changed with time
I thought, for once, you were the one
Never thought this day would come
Always thought you could be mine
I just want you
I want to go back in time
When it all started with me and you
I still feel like, lets sort things out
Cuz i love you and cant leave you 
and you will be my sunshine
Yea I don’t have many memories with you
But those conversations are nothing less than that
I never knew 
I would get this much obsessed with you
I still think what went wrong
I still think I was wrong and pure were you
Maybe I never understood you
I wish I could see things with your perspective
Maybe I am not as good as you 
Maybe be I am not for you
